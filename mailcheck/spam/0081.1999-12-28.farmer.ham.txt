Hi Akshay,

This is Zizi from the Talent Acquisition Team at Bytedance/TikTok. Thank you for your interest in the Frontend Engineer position at our company.
 
May I know your availability for the first round of video technical interviews? It will last around 1 hour. Normally 8am-12 pm or 1pm-5 pm or 7pm-11pm (Pacific Time) on weekdays works for the interviewer. Please provide us with at least 3 time slots for 11/30-12/2.

In the meantime, you will receive an NDA document from DocuSign soon. Please complete the Docusign at your earliest convenience.

After we receive your completed Docusign, we will then confirm the interview date and time and send the confirmation email with a website link from our system.
 
Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.

Best Regards,
